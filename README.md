# Salesforce-Data-Analysis-Project
A Data Analysis project analyzing Salesforce data

### Project Overview
The Salesforce Data Analysis Project aims to analyze Salesforce data to gain insights into data quality, future projections for 2024, and strategies to increase revenue. The analysis was performed exclusively using Excel.

### Data Source
Salesforce Revenue Data

### Tools
Project done exclusively within microsoft excel

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
Based on the data, the overall data quality is fairly clean. However, there are several data points that need attention. Specifically, some columns have over 10% of their data missing, which affects the overall data quality.

Additionally, there is a significant distribution of companies with fewer than 30,000 employees, alongside some companies with significantly higher employee counts. This disparity suggests the presence of outliers that could potentially skew the analysis.

In summary, while the dataset is generally clean, the following issues should be addressed to improve data quality:

Missing Values:
Some columns have more than 10% missing data, which impacts the integrity of the dataset. Imputing or removing these missing values is necessary.
Outliers:
The Employees column shows a heavy concentration of companies with less than 30,000 employees, but there are a few companies with much higher counts. These outliers need to be reviewed to ensure they do not distort the analysis.
By addressing these issues, the dataset can be made more robust, leading to more accurate and reliable insights.right skewed by outliers.
